STUDENT MANUAL – 2021  1. Vision , Mission & Values Vision To be an institution of excellence nurturing responsible global leaders for the greater common good and a sustainable future.  Mission • To disseminate knowledge in management through a portfolio of educational programs and publications • To extend frontiers of knowledge through relevant and contextual research • To nurture responsive ethical leaders sensitive to environment and society • To encourage critical thinking and continuous improvement • To inculcate a culture of innovation and entrepreneurship  Values  Inspired by the Jesuit spirit of “Magis”, XLRI will be guided by the following values:   ➢ Ethical Conduct ➢ Inclusiveness and Tolerance ➢ Integrity and Trust ➢ Creativity and Innovation ➢ Passion for Excellence ➢ Global Mindset ➢ Sensitive Social Conscience    2. Assurance of Learning  At XLRI, we work towards achieving certain learning expectations that are commonly identified as our program learning goals. We believe that the learning goals denote the desired forms of students’ learning, thinking and their behavior. These goals convey to students and faculty the educational outcomes towards which they are working and help in setting priorities, designing their learning experiences and fulfilling their educational expectations. While the learning goals cannot be exhaustively stated for any higher education program, it is possible to set educational targets and to assure that the learning is progressing in the specified direction. The learning expectations are derived from a balance of internal and external contributions to the definition of primary educational goals. Stakeholders representing different segments of society such as faculty members, students, industry fraternity, civil society and workers’ community contribute valuable perspectives on the needs of our graduates. These are what our graduates should value, comprehend and be able to associate with.  Assurance of these learning goals is therefore our highest priority. As an initial and critical step in its manifestation of learning, we developed a list of the learning goals. The list is in consonance with our Mission that set out our intentions, values and how our programs demonstrate our Mission. The learning goals, therefore, describe the desired educational accomplishments of various programs that we offer by translating the more general statement of the Mission into the educational accomplishments of our graduates.  Our endeavor is essentially twofold as we intend to help students to realize their full potential in their journey to become successful managers & entrepreneurs and aim at creating and disseminating knowledge through our research and degree programs.    4 There are two overarching values in our Vision that help us in understanding the purpose for which XLRI exists and help us in holding the Mission of the Institute and these are:  (a) A strong sense of excellence in everything that we do and  (b) Sensitivity and service orientation towards every stakeholder with whom we engage.   In deriving the learning goals from these strong underlying values, we hold (i) improvement orientation and quest for excellence, (ii) sound decision making and (iii) developing subject matter expertise and acquiring functional knowledge in one’s area, as the first three learning goals that are in harmony with the core value of excellence in everything that we do. Likewise, (iv) developing stakeholder sensitivity, viz., recognizing the importance of businesses to operate in a manner that is legal, ethical, profitable, sustainable and within social norms, (v) openness to and awareness of diversity across cultures and (vi) developing communication and influence skills of our graduates are the other three learning goals that are derived from our second core value of being sensitive and having service orientation towards all stakeholders which XLRI is committed for. Further details on learning goals and their sub-dimensions can be obtained from the faculty teaching a course or the office of the Dean on request.  Specific core and elective course offered in a program is designed to meet one or two learning goals. Since it will be less of a challenge for the students to meet those goal(s) if they know what they should be able to do by the end of the course, an outline detailing the course content, curriculum, session plan, pedagogy and evaluation shall carry necessary information concerning assurance of learning goal(s) for those courses from a program that are meant to assess the assurance of learning.  The outline, in effect, shall reach students before the classroom learning begins in every term.  At the end of a term, a student shall receive feedback (from faculty) on a 3-point scale that would reflect on the extent to which s/he fulfilled the educational expectations set through a specific learning goal in the given course. The score will be sufficiently indicative of a student’s progress in the specified direction. Institute as well as an individual student has right to exhibit the learning goal scores, wherever desired or obligatory. Institute may assign designated weightage to these scores in determining a students’ overall rank for medals, etc. Nevertheless, student’s CQPI shall not reflect her/his performance on learning goal(s) for individual course as well as aggregate.   3.

Academic Year  The academic year consists of three Terms. The average duration of each Term is approximately 11 weeks.  Terms I, II & III refer to the first year students and Terms IV, V & VI refer to the second year students.  5. Registration 5.1  All students are required to register in person on the Registration Day as indicated for each Term in the Calendar. The student who fails to register without prior permission will be deemed to have left the programme.  A student who does not register within 72 hours of the time specified for registration is liable to be directed to withdraw from the programme with no stigma attached. If, however, the student does not withdraw from the programme within 48 hours after being so directed, he will be liable for expulsion from the Institute.   5.2  Registration for Term I:   (a) A Preparatory programme is conducted on virtual mode for the first year students on Excel and Accounting.  This is scheduled before the students arrive on campus.  (b) When the students arrive on campus, an Orientation / Preparatory programme is held following the Welcome programme and Registration. Attendance at the same is compulsory unless informed to and approved by the Dean’s office.    (c) First year students have to register for Term-I on the date of Registration specified by the Dean’s Office.  Students whose final year mark-sheets are awaited, should submit them latest as specified by the Dean’s Office.  Failing to do so will result in cancellation of admission. The modes of registration are as follows:                  Online Registration: Carry supporting documents of Academic qualifications and work experience as applicable [Exact date of Document Verification and Manual Registration of Term – I will be communicated by the Dean’s Office]. Carry two passport size photographs.  5.3  Registration for Other Terms:   (a) In all Terms, except Term I, students are required to register on the first day of the Term, unless permitted by the Dean to register on a later date (refer 5.1).  A student, who fails to register on the first day of the Terms [except Term I], will be allowed to register only after he has obtained special permission from the Dean, subject to his paying a latefee, which in no case shall be less than  2,000/- per day.   (b) Second year students resuming after summer vacation must submit a certificate of completion, issued by the summer project guide (from the organization where the summer project was undertaken), at the time of registration for Term IV. A student, who fails to submit the certificate as mentioned above, will be given provisional entry only into second year.  Failure to submit the summer project completion certificate within four weeks from the date of registration [Term – IV], will disqualify the student for the award of the diploma [also see Qualifying Standards Section 21.2 (a)].     6    6.   Online Classroom Decorum (a) Students must ensure that they have a reliable internet connection and any software that might be required to avoid connectivity issues so that they can have an uninterrupted and smooth classroom experience.

(f) Follow classroom etiquettes and instructor’s rules if any. (g) The Dean (Academics) Office will keep you informed regarding any changes or updates.  7.  Curriculum Design 7.1 The academic programmes consist of Core (compulsory) and Elective (optional) courses.  7.2 Core courses in the programme are designed to:  (a) provide basic conceptual and analytical knowledge and inculcate attitudes and skills necessary for managerial effectiveness;  (b) develop an integrated view of organizational and managerial functioning and an understanding of the interdependencies of subsystems; and  (c) create an awareness and understanding of environmental forces impinging on managerial behavior. 7.3 The elective courses provide an opportunity for concentration on focus areas to enable the student to cope with the demands of the job in the early years of his professional career.  7.4  A copy of the Syllabus is available on the AIS. The syllabus is only an indicative tool.  The detailed course structure would be given by faculty teaching the course.  8.  Course Workload   8.1  A 3 credit course is taken as a full course for the purpose of calculating the number of courses completed for a programme.  Other courses of different credits are calculated accordingly (e.g.  1.5 credit course is equivalent to a half course and 4.5 credit course is equivalent to one and a half course for the purpose of calculating workload).  A student is expected to put in at least 100 hours of work in a 3 credit course including 30 contact hours in class.  In case of a 1.5 credit course, the time devoted would be 50 and 15 hours respectively.  Accordingly, a 4.5 credit course would require 150 hours of work including 45 contact hours.  8.2   The total credits for BM program shall be a minimum of 105 credits and HRM program shall be a minimum of 108 credits. A maximum of 114 credits is permissible for BM and HRM. The nine credits or 3 extra courses for BM and in HRM six credits or 2 extra courses, could be anything that students want to study. For PGD HRM program, the three extra credit is for a core course titled MIS which will be offered to students in the 1st year. [For the students of PGD HRM, the MIS core course will be taught in the first Term with one credit portion. The remaining two credits shall be covered in Term III]. 8.3  The total number of credits for the core courses are 66 (Sixty-six) for HRM and 63 (Sixty-three) for BM.  The Term-wise distribution of credits in the first year for HRM shall be 20-23-23 and BM shall be 21-22-20 as applicable. The elective courses are not offered in the first year but during Term IV, V & VI in the second year. 8.4 A minimum of 42 (Forty–Two) credits is required from Elective courses to qualify for Diploma in BM and HRM.  7 8.5   The Minimum & Maximum number of credits (including Dissertation, Special Elective Course, Extra Credit Course and CIS) in any given Term in second year should be between 12-18 credits. However, students going on the Exchange Program in Term V shall be allowed to opt for a maximum of 15 credits in their respective foreign universities.      9. Attendance  9.1  It is mandatory for the students to be regular and punctual in all the classes, without exception. Individual faculty members may, at their discretion, assign some weightage to attendance, attending quizzes/surprise quizzes in class and class participation in the evaluation of the course. In such an event, absenteeism on the part of the student, may adversely affect all the course evaluation components that requires the presence of students in class. 9.2     Any absence occasioned by emergency whether personal or professional must be notified to and approved by the Dean’s Office in advance with each faculty concerned being notified as well from whose classes such a leave of absence is sought. Else, any such absence without prior approval of the Dean (Academics) Office will be considered as a serious breach of discipline.  In such cases, a fine of INR 2000/- per day will be levied. The student may even be directed to withdraw from the programme with no stigma attached. If, the student does not withdraw from the programme within a week of being so directed, he/she will be liable for expulsion from the Institute. 9.3   Attendance during Institute Functions is compulsory. The list of the mandatory attendance Functions are: a. Alumni Homecoming b. Dr JRD Tata Oration c. Dr Varghese Kurien Memorial Oration d. Ensemble-Valhalla e. Marketing Fair f.  Republic Day and Independence Day Celebrations. A fine of ₹ 2,000/- will be imposed for non-attendance in any of the above mentioned functions.  9.4    For both first year and second year BM & HRM students no penalty based on attendance will be applied if a student is absent from classes due to participation in competitions approved by the Faculty Placement Committee and communicated to the Dean’s Office before the competitions, provided the student has more than the mandated minimum 80% attendance. A student can attend maximum five “approved competitions” by the Faculty Placement Committee in a year. 9.5 Students should ensure that the attendance requirements, as stipulated in this section, are met irrespective of any compulsions.  Absence for attending any activity except for the one mentioned in 9.4, is also treated similarly for calculating attendance as per Section 9.9. 9.6 The Dean or the faculty will not be responsible, if the student suffers loss in the evaluation of any segment on account of his absence. The faculty may administer make-up tests/assignments only to those students who remained absent with prior permission. However, for the purpose of calculating the number of classes missed, there is no distinction between leave sanctioned or not sanctioned, or any other case. The total classes missed would be used for calculating the grade deduction by the Dean (Academics) office. 9.7  The faculty in discussion with the Dean (Academics) shall be free to adopt a strict measure to regulate attendance, penalize absence and ensure smooth and undisturbed learning in the class. The special attendance norms will be specified beforehand in the course outline. Similarly, the faculty may assign marks for attendance and can reduce the marks / grade point for low attendance which may be stricter than the Institute’s policy on evaluation.  8 9.8  If a student puts in less than 50% attendance in 3 (three) courses or more, he will be required to withdraw from the programme. 9.9 In case the faculty does not have any absence penalty explicitly specified in the Course Outline, the Institute’s policy on absence will be implemented as given below.     Attendance Range    No. of Classes   Grade Reduction    80 - 100%              16 & more classes No Grade Loss   70 – 75%                14-15 classes  Less One Grade Point   55 – 65%                11-13 classes  Less Two Grade Points     0 – 50%                <=10 classes   Repeat the Course  9.10 However, a student would not be punished twice on account of attendance.  That is, if a course has a penalty for each class missed and a student loses a grade because of marks for attendance, then the student would not be penalized again by another grade loss.  10.  Waiver 10.1 A student may be granted waiver in respect of a core course, provided the course faculty and the Dean are satisfied that he has adequate knowledge of the course. In such an event, he stands exempted from attending the classes of that course.  10.2  To qualify for a waiver, a student must            (a)  make a request, in writing, to the Dean(Academics) through the course faculty for the waiver at the beginning of the Term;            (b)  take a written qualifying test designed by the faculty teaching the course to ascertain the knowledge of the student in the course; and  submit a written assignment(s) as prescribed by the course faculty.   10.3 The grade for the course will be determined on the basis of the performance of the student in the qualifying test and the written assignment(s).   10.4 Waiver is however, not allowed for students who are repeating the year or repeating certain course(s) due to poor academic performance earlier.  11. Summer Project 11.1 Summer project investigates some significant aspect of a managerial problem. It gives students an opportunity to observe a business organisation in operation and to sharpen their knowledge and skills by putting them to use. Besides providing an opportunity to enhance their understanding of managerial problems, summer project also gives students practical experience that will help them to plan their careers. 11.2 Summer Project is a compulsory non-credit course.  A student is required to do a Summer Project on any aspect of HRM / BM, as applicable, in industry for eight to ten weeks at the end of the first year (April - June).  While registering for Term IV, a student must submit to Dean’s Office, a summer project satisfactory completion certificate from the summer project company guide [refer Section 5.3 (b) and Section 22.2 (a)], in our Institute format. 11.3 Students will be entitled to receive the Diploma only after completing the summer project satisfactorily. A student who receives an “unsatisfactory” remark will have to undergo another Summer Project in order to become eligible to receive the Diploma. 11.4 Students who receive adverse comments from their company guides will be liable for disciplinary action and will have to complete another summer project or have to do whatever is required to get a satisfactory completion certificate from the company.  11.5    It is mandatory to submit a Project Report of 5000 words. 11.6    Students on a Sabbatical will be interning with their company.   9  12.  Dissertation 12.1 Dissertation is optional. A student can opt for a dissertation in lieu of a 3 credit elective course in Term V.  Students will be allowed to drop those courses, where, by dropping, the number of creditors will not go below 20.   However, only those students meeting the following criteria will be eligible to do dissertation on a topic of their choice in a related field of HRM or BM.  (a)     HRM students doing Dissertation should have CQPI of 5.500 upto Term III and also an average of 6.000 in related courses as follows:                                                                                                                                                                                                                         (a) For OB related topic OB I, OB II and OB III (b) For HR related topic  FHRM, PMA, HRP and WADA (c) For IR / Law related topic Fundamentals of Labour Laws, Fundamentals of Industrial Relations, Employment Relations Law: Law of Industrial Relations, Employment Relations Law: Law of Social Security. It is the student’s responsibility to check whether he is eligible for doing Dissertation. (b) BM students should have CQPI of 5.500 upto Term III and also an average of 6.000 in the functional area of the Dissertation topic.  Dissertation shall not be counted in any Area of Concentration.  12.2 The dissertation will be in lieu of a 3-credit elective course and is taken into account for the computation of QPI and CQPI like any other full credit course and shall be added to the courses scheduled in Term V.   12.3  Students should directly contact the faculty for guidance in the dissertation.  12.4 In case the dissertation topic is such that it requires the guidance of a part-time or visiting faculty, the concerned Area Chairperson, in consultation with the Dean (Academics), may permit the student to undertake the study under the guidance of the part-time or visiting faculty. No parttime or visiting faculty can act as a dissertation guide for more than 2 [two] students in all. No full-time faculty member can act as a guide for more than 5 [five] students in all.  12.5 Where the dissertation topic involves study covering more than one discipline, the student may, with the approval of the primary guide, opt for a secondary (joint) guide from the relevant discipline.  The dissertation will, however, be evaluated by the primary guide in consultation with the secondary guide.   12.6 The dissertation proposal should be finalized by the date as specified by Dean’s Office i.e. the proposal form with the faculty guide(s) signature should be submitted to Dean’s Office. Failure to submit a signed proposal from the faculty guide would be equivalent to a student not being interested in taking up the Dissertation. 12.7   Dissertation report should be submitted on a date specified by the Dean’s Office.  12.8 Dissertation Grading:  The Dissertation guide has to choose two other members of Faculty [at least one from their area) in consultation with Associate Dean, FPM and Research for evaluation and grading of the Dissertation. 13.  Electives 13.1  Students are required to choose electives for their second year of study in order to complete the minimum requirement of 105 credits for BM and 108 for HRM (the maximum being 114 credits).  13.2  In the BM programme, to fulfill the 42 credits (equivalent to 14 electives of 3 credits each), a student is free to choose from the elective courses offered to them. A student must choose elective courses from at least two areas.  No student will be allowed to opt for more than 30 credits (equivalent to 10 elective courses) from any one area. However, to fulfill the requirement of area(s) of concentration, a student is required to do an equivalent of five 3-credit electives or 15 credits in total (which could be in the form of 3 credits or 1.5 credits) in an area listed below:  10  (a)  Economics  (b)  Finance  (c)  Information Systems    (d)  Marketing  (e)  Production, Operations & Decision Sciences   (f)  Strategy   A student can opt for a maximum of two areas only for concentration. A few elective courses are common to more than one area as mentioned in the Syllabus. Such type of electives will be counted in one area only as per the choice of the student. Students of BM programme including those going for Exchange Programme will not be allowed to take a course exclusively offered to the students in HRM programme and vice-versa.  13.3 Since the HRM programme itself is a specialized programme, there are no separate areas of concentration. Students are required to choose 42 credits from the elective courses offered to them. Out of these, a minimum of 18 credits (equivalent to six electives) should be from those listed under the head “HRM Area” in the Syllabus. An HRM student may, if he so desires, opt for a maximum of 12 credits each from Economics, Information Systems and/or Strategy Areas.  13.4   A student of HRM can opt for a maximum of 6 credits from other Areas (i.e. Finance, Marketing and Operations Areas) of his interest. Similarly, a student of BM can opt for a maximum of 9 credits.  If the schedule permits.  14.  Pre-Registration of Elective Courses 14.1 In the elective courses to be offered in the 2nd year will be announced in the month of April, during the Summer Training.  Students should get clarification on electives, if required, from Area Chairpersons and / or the course instructors before the deadline for registration of electives.    14.2  Electives which have a ceiling on the number of students, the concerned faculty will announce the final list of selected students for each elective. Students who have registered for an elective on AIS but have not been selected for the course will be given a chance to opt for another elective. Detailed information on date(s) for registration and finalization of electives for 2nd year will be announced in Term – 3 of the first year. Students need to strictly adhere to the deadlines, as no changes in electives would be permitted after the deadlines.  14.3  Faculty, in consultation with the area, may evolve suitable criteria to select students for their electives. Such criteria will normally be based on:   (a)  the academic background, aptitude and level of performance of the students in related courses; and  (b)  the number of students that can be admitted to the elective given the pedagogy of the course.  (c) Or any other criteria which the Faculty and the Area jointly decides.     15.  Dropping of Elective Courses 15.1 In order to offer an elective course, there should be a minimum registration of 20 creditors failing which the elective course will be dropped.   15.2 In event of an elective being dropped as stated above, the students will be given option to register for other electives (as per Section 13.2).    16.  Scheduling of classes  11  The class schedule will be regularly updated in the Class Schedule System (CSS). No student shall be allowed to approach the faculty for rescheduling of the classes. Any such request needs to be made to the Dean’s Office (Academics).  17.  Course of Independent Study (CIS) 17.1 The CIS allows for an in-depth exploration of a topic in the student’s field of concentration or area of special interest. It allows the integration of several fields of study in searching for the solution of a single problem. It provides valuable experience in the research process, definition of the problem, search for relevant data, analysis of the data and drawing conclusions and implications from it.   An acceptable CIS may take many forms. It may be a case study, describing and analysing a particular incident, illuminating a variety of managerial problems. The CIS may take the form of a study in which the pertinent elements of a policy problem are studied and weighed to reach conclusions as to possible courses of action. The CIS may be a historical study, analysing and searching for implications in a particular period. It may involve the design of a new method or a comparison of pertinent factors in two or more methods. The CIS may, of course, consist of the formulation and testing a hypothesis relevant to management. Data sources are: books, articles, published reports, results of interviews, response to questionnaires, etc. 17.2 A student can opt for a CIS, if the identified topic is not offered as an elective.  That is, a student cannot do a CIS on a topic which is offered as an elective.  The approval of the CIS topic (as described in Section 17.5) has to be completed in the Term preceding the Term in which the CIS is planned to be taken up.   17.3 Second year students may opt for a maximum of 1 (one) CIS, over and above the minimum number of elective courses specified (subject to Section 7.3).   The grade obtained in CIS shall not be taken into account for the computation of QPI / CQPI.  The CIS topic will, however, be shown in the Final Transcript along with the grade obtained.  17.4 A student is required to have a faculty guide for the CIS. The responsibility for securing a faculty guide rests with the student. The selection of topic, meetings with the faculty guide and other course related interactions are also left to the initiative of the student. 17.5 After the topic has been finalized, the student undertaking the CIS has to submit a brief synopsis to the faculty concerned.  The synopsis is circulated among the area faculty for suggestions.  After incorporating suggestions received from the area, the proposal has to be sent to Dean’s Office.  The Dean may forward it to other areas, if he feels that inputs from other areas may enrich the study.  Subsequent to this, the Dean’s Office would approve the CIS.   17.6 Performance on the CIS is evaluated by the standards of • good scholarship and integrity,  • courtesy in crediting sources of information, • objective standards of precision, logic and use of evidence, • imagination and  • the ability to reach and state defensible conclusion. 17.7  The CIS should be manageable in terms of time and effort. No student is permitted to choose a topic likely to be classified as confidential, for reasons of national security, or restricted for proprietary or other similar reasons. 17.8 Faculty guiding a CIS has the discretion to decide the criteria for evaluation.  However, the student must make an open-house presentation after completing the study. 17.9 A student failing to complete an approved CIS in time would result in the award of an Incomplete grade for CIS. As a result, the student would not be eligible for the Diploma with the Incomplete Grade.    12 18.  Examinations 18.1   Offline Examination Rules 18.1.1Students should report at the examination venue at least 5 minutes before the scheduled time and take their seats according to the randomized roll number chart put up on the notice board.

Evaluation  19.1  The criteria for evaluation shall be shared by the faculty in the course outline at the beginning of the Term. 19.2  The components for evaluation of a course may, in general, include a combination of attendance, quizzes, assignments, fieldwork, level of class participation, mid-term, end-term, etc. There will be a minimum of three components. The weightage of any component should not exceed 40%.   19.3  The decision of the faculty regarding grades or any segment of evaluation will be final. A student who needs clarification of grades may discuss with the faculty concerned within a week of receiving the grades.  19.4  Faculty will give feedback to students periodically on their performance through evaluation components and assessment marks, written comments on answer sheets or through individual meetings.  19.5  If a student has missed a mid-term or an end-term on account of authorized absence, he should approach the faculty concerned for administering a make-up examination and notify the Dean (Academics) accordingly. The student’s transcript will carry an “IC” grade until and unless the Dean (Academics) receives the final grade from the faculty.   19.6 If, for any reason, the student fails to avail himself of the opportunity to make-up the missed examination(s), he will be finally awarded “IC” grade for that course or for that segment of evaluation, as the case may be and no second opportunity for a re-test will be given.  19.7 A student, who has obtained an “IC” grade should complete the requirements of the course to the satisfaction of the faculty within 3 [three] weeks from date on which the grade is announced or, where the course falls in Term VI, within a week of the completion of Term VI, failing which he will be required to repeat the same course completely as and when it is offered by a faculty in the following year.  It should be clearly understood that the student will not be entitled to receive the Diploma until he completes the requirements stipulated here-in-before and after.         19.8  Students are required to strictly adhere to the deadlines prescribed for the submission of all written assignments, projects and reports. Late submission is liable for reduction in grade in that component as indicated hereunder:       14 Delay  Reduction  Example   1 week or less  1 grade point  From B+ to B   1 week to 2 weeks 2 grade points  From B+ to C+  Above 2 weeks   3 grade points  From B+ to C  If a written assignment is overdue for more than 2 weeks, the faculty may refuse to accept the assignment and award zero marks to the student concerned for that segment of evaluation.     This would be applicable for Dissertation/CIS also. 19.9 Normal requests for Re-evaluation   Re-evaluation of examination/term paper should be avoided. On request made by a student for re-evaluation, the faculty member concerned may in consultation with the Dean (Academics) reevaluate the answer book and submit the revised grade, if any, before the publication of the same by the Dean’s Office (also refer Section 22.2).    20.  Mid-term Feedback and Final Communication of Grades 20.1 The Faculty will communicate, mid-term feedback comprising of 35%-40% of the total marks at least 3 weeks before the commencement of the end-term.   20.2 The faculty concerned will announce the grades to the students directly before submission to the Dean. No change in grade will be allowed, once the grade-sheet is submitted to the Dean.  The Dean’s Office will announce the grades through Intranet (AIS: Academic Information System) as and when received and the students concerned should promptly check their grades through AIS (http://acad.xlri.ac.in).   20.3  The grades of sponsored candidates, if any, may be communicated to the sponsoring organisations at the request of the student and/or of the sponsoring organization.  As a general rule, the grades of a student will not be communicated to any other person or organization without the consent of the student concerned.   21.  Grading System 21.1 A nine-point grading system is used for evaluation. The 9 grades and their corresponding quality points are given below:   Performance Fail Average Good Excellent Grades F D D+ C C+ B B+ A A+ Grade Points 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8  21.2 The faculty will inform the evaluation pattern in his course outline to be given at the beginning.   21.3 The index of a student’s performance in each Term is the QPI. It is derived by averaging the quality points secured by a student in all the courses of the Term.  21.4  The index of a student’s overall performance is the CQPI, which is the weighted average of the successive term QPIs.  21.5  A faculty would award an Incomplete Grade (“IC” grade) if a student fails to complete the academic requirements of the course.  An incomplete grade would require a student to repeat the course the next time it is offered.  A student is not eligible for the Diploma with an “IC” grade in any course (including CIS Course).   15 22.  Qualifying Standards 22.1 The qualifying standards of the students for the promotion to senior classes, continuation in the programme and successful completion of the postgraduate diploma programme are decided based on the following criteria:  (a) the failure points as given below     Failure Points: F = 1, D = 0.67, D+ = 0.5 and  (the above points will be calculated proportionately for courses with credits greater or lesser than 3)   (b) the total CQPI and  (c) the student has not been debarred on grounds of any disciplinary action taken against     him/her. 22.2 Minimum CQPI required at the end of first and second years  (a) 4.000 at the end of the first year (CQPI of Terms I, II & III) and a satisfactory completion certificate from the Summer Project Company Guide.
