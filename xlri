Assurance of Learning At XLRI, we work towards achieving certain learning expectations that are commonly identified as our program learning goals. We believe that the learning goals denote the desired forms of students’ learning, thinking and their behavior. These goals convey to students and faculty the educational outcomes towards which they are working and help in setting priorities, designing their learning experiences and fulfilling their educational expectations. While the learning goals cannot be exhaustively stated for any higher education program, it is possible to set educational targets and to assure that the learning is progressing in the specified direction. The learning expectations are derived from a balance of internal and external contributions to the definition of primary educational goals. Stakeholders
